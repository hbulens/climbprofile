## Project Overview

This project allows users to generate detailed climb profiles from GPX files. It's designed for cyclists, hikers, and outdoor enthusiasts who need to visualize elevation data and understand the difficulty of different routes. The application processes GPX files and outputs a graphical profile of the climb, helping users to plan and prepare for their activities.
Features

- GPX File support: Easily upload and process GPX files to generate climb profiles.
- Interactive graphs: View detailed climb profiles with interactive graphs showing elevation changes.
- Customizable output: Adjust settings for the climb profile to focus on specific sections or data points.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Bun (for managing the project)

## Local Development

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/hbulens/climbprofile
cd climbprofile
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
bun i
```

3. Start the Local Web Server:

```bash
bun dev
```

The server will start at http://localhost:5173. 
Open this URL in your browser to use the application.

## Usage

Once the server is running:

- Upload a GPX file: Click the upload button and select a GPX file from your computer.
- Generate climb profile: The application will process the file and display the climb profile.
- Interact with the graph: Use your mouse to hover over sections of the graph for detailed elevation data.

## Contribute

## Support

If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to open an issue on GitHub.

## Roadmap

Planned features for future releases include:

- GPX data analysis: Add more detailed data analysis, such as speed and heart rate integration.
- Profile sharing: Enable users to share generated climb profiles on social media.
- Multi-language support: Add support for multiple languages.
